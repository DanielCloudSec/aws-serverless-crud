# 🛠️ AWS Serverless CRUD API

This project is a **serverless CRUD API** built on AWS using the following services:

- **API Gateway** – RESTful interface
- **AWS Lambda** – Backend logic (Node.js)
- **DynamoDB** – NoSQL database
- **IAM** – Secure permissions
- **CloudWatch** – Logging & debugging

This was built as a personal project based on a tutorial by [Code with Vinnie](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithVinnie) to gain AWS experience and showcase skills in serverless architecture.
